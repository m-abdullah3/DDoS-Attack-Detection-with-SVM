# DDoS-Attack-Detection-with-SVM
This project focuses on DDoS attack detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. We'll employ Linear, Polynomial, and Sigmoid kernels, preprocess the dataset for consistency, and evaluate model effectiveness using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
